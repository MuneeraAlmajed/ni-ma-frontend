## User Stories

### Authentication and Accounts (all roles)
1. As a visitor, I want to register as a Client or Collector, so that I can use the platform.
2. As a user, I want to log in and receive a secure token (JWT), so that my session is protected.
3. As a user, I want to view and edit my profile (name, phone, area), so that my details stay accurate.
4. As a user, I want to reset my password, so that I can regain access if I forget it.

### Client (donor)
1. As a client, I want to add an item with its name, category, condition and description, so that I can offer it for donation.
2. As a client, I want to attach a photo to my item, so that collectors can see what it looks like.
3. As a client, I want to edit or delete my items before they are collected, so that I can fix mistakes or change my mind.
4. As a client, I want to sumbit a donation request with my pickup address and preferred time, so that a collector can come and get the item. 
5. As a client, I want to track my donation status (pending, assigned, collected, completed), so that I know what is happening.
6. As a client, I want to see all my past and current donations, so that I have a record of what I gave.
7. As a client, I want to cancel a donation that is still pending, so that I am not commited if my plans change.

### Collector
1. As a collector, I want to see the donations assigned to me with their item details, address and pickup time, so that I can plan my route.
2. As a collector, I want to browser pending donations in my area and rrequest to take them, so that I can pickup more items.
3. As a collector, I want to upload a photo as a proof of collection, so that the pickup is verified.
4. As a collector, I want to report a failed pickup with a reason. 

### Admin
1. As a admin, I want to view, activate, deactive or delete users, so that I can keep the platform safe.
2. As a admin, I want to view all the items and dontaions with filters (status, category, date), so that I can monitor activity.
3. As an admin, I want to assign a pending donation to a collector, so that every request gets handled.
4. As an admin, I want to review collection proof photos and approve or reject them,, so that I can confirom the donation actually happened.
5. As an admin, I want to mark an approved donation as completed, so that the process closes properly.
6. As an admin, I want to remove inappropriate donations, so that the platform stays clean.
7. As an admin, I want a simple  dashboard (total donations, completed, pending, top categories), so that I can see the platform impact.

### System and Security
1. As the system, I want to enforce role-based access, so that a client cannot see another client's data and a collector cannot see unassigned donations.
2. As the system, I want to allow only valid status transitions (pending → assigned → collected → completed), so that the data stays consistent.
3. As the system, I want to validate all input (Pydantic) and limit upload file type and size, so that bad or unsafe data is rejected.
